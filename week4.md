## Learning Activities & Resources  
- Installed and configured XAMPP to host WordPress locally.  
- Troubleshot Apache and MySQL server conflicts on macOS (resolving Nginx and port 80/443 issues).  
- Created a new WordPress database and configured `wp-config.php` manually.  
- Installed the “Twenty Twenty-Three” theme and customized its layout, fonts, and color palette for *Oddinary Café*.  
- Created multiple pages (Home, Menu, About, Contact) and linked them through navigation buttons.  
- Tested the local site at `http://localhost:8080` to ensure functionality and proper linking.  
- Referred to WordPress documentation and community forums for local environment troubleshooting.  

## Estimated Hours  
Approximately **2.5 hours**  

## Content Insights  
This week, I learned how a local environment supports safe experimentation before deploying online. Understanding how Apache, MySQL, and PHP work together through XAMPP clarified the backend mechanics of CMS platforms. I also gained practical experience editing configuration files and troubleshooting common startup errors, which strengthened my technical independence.  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights  
Running WordPress locally mirrors real-world developer workflows for testing and debugging before production. The hands-on problem-solving process built resilience and improved my confidence in managing server setups. These skills are highly applicable to web development, digital product management, and technical operations roles. Going forward, I aim to refine the *Oddinary Café* site by enhancing visual consistency and preparing for potential online deployment.
