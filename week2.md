## Content Insights

This week, I learned that Joomla separates **content, structure, and design**, which makes customizing a site much easier than coding everything manually. Templates allow rapid visual changes to give a site a unique look. Proper page layout and navigation are essential for usability, and images/text must be correctly referenced to display properly. Working on a live CMS helped me understand how changes are rendered immediately. Overall, this practical reinforced the importance of planning content, structure, and design before expanding a website.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Learning to use a CMS like Joomla is directly relevant for web development and digital content management roles. Being able to quickly prototype and customize a live site is a practical skill for internships and freelance projects. Hands-on experience with menus, templates, and articles mirrors real-world web development workflows. I also found that combining tutorials, documentation, and experimentation is the most effective way to learn new software tools efficiently. Going forward, I plan to continue building the Joomla site while maintaining a structured workflow for content and design.
