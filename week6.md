# Week 6 — Practical 6: Group Setup

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week was mainly about getting familiar with the teamwork tools we will be using throughout the project. The initial setup of Slack, GitHub, and Trello was handled by Kaixin, and I joined once everything was in place so I could start integrating into the workflow.

I joined our team Slack workspace here:
https://cp3402-groupb.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-3hj9ym1b5-kV2pWKyr0cJCI0d0Fxj3Mg  
This will be our main communication channel for updates, questions, and progress check-ins.

I also joined our GitHub repository:
https://github.com/cp3402-students/project-2025-tr3-cp3402-jcu-teamb  
and checked the project structure and README so I understand how the repo is organised.

For task planning, I joined the Trello board:
https://trello.com/b/ipXHFzyn/cp3402-groupb  
I looked through the workflow columns (Backlog → To Do → Doing → Review → Done) to see how tasks will be tracked. The **Group Agreement** card is also there, which we will complete together in our next meeting.
The GitHub → Slack integration was already set up, so commit activity from the repository will automatically appear in our Slack channel for everyone to see.


## Estimated Hours  
**~1 hour** (joining platforms + reviewing setup)

## Content Insights

Even though I didn’t set up the tools myself, reviewing how they are connected helped me understand how we’ll work as a group. Having Slack, GitHub, and Trello linked means communication and task progress will stay transparent, which should prevent confusion once development starts. The workflow on Trello also makes it clear how tasks will move between stages, which will help with accountability.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

This setup process reflects how real development teams organise their work. Knowing how to navigate shared workspaces, task boards, and version control platforms is important in any collaborative tech role. Now that I’m familiar with the workflow, I’ll be ready to contribute once we finalise the Group Agreement and start dividing tasks in the next stage.
