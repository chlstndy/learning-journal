# Week 7 — Practical 7: PHP 

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I worked on the PHP practical where I had to create a small mini-site that demonstrates the core PHP features. I made a simple project folder called motivator, and inside it I wrote several files:
index.php, about.php, header.php, footer.php, and functions.php.
For this practical, I focused on understanding how PHP behaves when mixed with HTML. I used echo to output different types of HTML tags, wrote if/else conditions to change messages, and created loops (for, while, foreach) to display items from an array. I also created my own function with a parameter and placed it inside functions.php to keep things tidy.
To avoid repeating the same layout, I used include to pull in a shared header and footer on both pages. Even though I didn’t run PHP locally on my Mac, I still completed all the code required for the prac and made sure each feature was included in its own file.

## Estimated Hours
~1.5 hours

## Content Insights
Doing this practical helped me understand how PHP actually runs behind the scenes. Compared to just writing pure HTML, PHP gives a lot more control because it can change what appears on the page depending on variables, conditions, or loops.
The part that stood out the most was how include works. It instantly made the project feel cleaner and more “real,” because it imitates how actual websites reuse navigation bars, headers, and footers. Writing my own function also helped reinforce the idea of keeping logic reusable instead of repeating it.
Overall, it was a simple task, but it gave me a clearer picture of how server-side logic connects to the front end.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights
Even though PHP is considered an older language, it still matters a lot in the industry, especially for WordPress-based websites. Understanding the basics now means I’ll have an easier time modifying templates or debugging CMS-related issues in the future.
Learning how logic, functions, and loops integrate with web pages also strengthens general programming skills. This kind of experience is helpful for future web subjects and even small freelance web tasks.
