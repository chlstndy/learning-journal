## Estimated Hours

**1.5–2 hours**

## Content Insights

This task helped me understand how child themes allow customization without modifying the parent theme directly. The parent theme’s stylesheet loads first, and the child theme stylesheet is applied afterward, which lets me override design elements safely. Once I understood the stylesheet order and enqueue process, adjusting visual styles became straightforward.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

Knowing how to create and manage child themes is useful in real-world web development, especially in roles involving website maintenance or freelance projects. Many sites rely on pre-built themes, so being able to customize them without breaking updates is practical. This exercise improved my understanding of theme structure, CSS overrides, and using WordPress as a flexible CMS. Going forward, I plan to continue refining the styling and layout while keeping a clean workflow.
