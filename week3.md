Content Insights
This week, I learned that WordPress, like Joomla, separates content, structure, and design, but it is more intuitive for rapid prototyping and theme customization. Themes provide a ready-made structure that can be modified without coding. Proper page hierarchy and menus are crucial for usability, and live previewing helps identify design issues quickly. This practical reinforced the value of CMS tools in efficiently building functional and visually appealing websites.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Using WordPress is directly relevant for roles in web development, digital content management, and startup operations. Being able to quickly set up and customize a live website mirrors real-world workflows, enhancing employability for internships or freelance projects. Experimenting with themes, menus, and posts also improves problem-solving and adaptability when working with new software tools. Going forward, I plan to continue refining the WordPress site while maintaining a structured workflow for content and design management.

## Group Formation Insights:

I was approached by a group member, Adrian, who asked me to add him as a friend so I could be invited to the group WeChat chat.
I joined the chat and observed the group dynamics, noting how communication is structured and who actively participates.
This experience helped me reflect on what makes a good group member—proactive communication, responsiveness, and clarity of expectations—which I think is valuable for teamwork in future projects and professional settings.
