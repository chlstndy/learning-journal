## Estimated Hours
Approximately 5 hours

## Content Insights
This week, I re-learned that HTML provides the structure and content of a website, while CSS (and frameworks like Bootstrap) control the visual styling and layout. Using Bootstrap’s grid system made it much easier to create a responsive layout without manually writing all the CSS from scratch. I also realized that images must be properly referenced relative to the file paths in the project folder. GitHub Pages is a simple way to host static websites and view changes live, which is very useful for testing and submission. Overall, this practical reinforced the importance of separating structure (HTML), style (CSS), and content (text/images) in web development.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning to use Bootstrap and GitHub Pages is directly relevant to real-world web development tasks. Being able to quickly prototype and host a website online is a valuable skill for internships and future projects. I also discovered that combining tutorials, documentation, and hands-on experimentation is the most effective way for me to learn web design. Going forward, I plan to maintain a structured workflow where I plan the content first, implement it in HTML, style it with CSS/Bootstrap, and then host it online for testing and feedback.
